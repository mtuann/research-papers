# Research Papers Shiny App

This repository contains R code for deploying a Shiny app that enables users to explore research papers published by AI and ML researchers. The app utilizes the `shiny` package in R to create an interactive [web application](https://mtuann.shinyapps.io/research-papers/).

## Deployment
- The app is live at [https://mtuann.shinyapps.io/research-papers/](https://mtuann.shinyapps.io/research-papers/).

## Features
- Users can search for papers by:
  - Title
  - Author
  - Venue
  - Year

### Current Topics
The app features a subset of papers from the following topics:
- [Federated Learning](https://github.com/mtuann/federated-learning-updated-papers)
- [Backdoor Learning](https://github.com/mtuann/backdoor-ai-resources)
- [FL - Awesome (by Yuwen Yang)](https://youngfish42.github.io/Awesome-FL/)
- [Machine Unlearning](https://github.com/mtuann/machine-unlearning-papers)
- [Large Language Models](https://github.com/mtuann/llm-updated-papers)
- [Adversarial Learning](https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2019/all-adversarial-example-papers.html)

The app is regularly updated with new papers.
