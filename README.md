This repository contains `R code` for deploying a Shiny app that allows users to explore the research papers AI/ ML researchers have published. The app uses the `shiny` package in R to create an interactive [web](https://mtuann.shinyapps.io/research-papers/) application.

If you find this application useful, you can support me by buying me a coffee. 
You can use either [Paypal](https://paypal.me/AIsmylife) or Techcombank (Vietnam).

- The app is deployed at [https://mtuann.shinyapps.io/research-papers/](https://mtuann.shinyapps.io/research-papers/).

- The app allows users to search for papers by `title`, `author`, `venue`, and `year`.

Currently, the app contains a subset of papers from the following topics:
- [Federated Learning](https://github.com/mtuann/federated-learning-updated-papers)
- [Backdoor Learning](https://github.com/mtuann/backdoor-ai-resources)
- [arXiv]()

The app is updated regularly with new papers.
